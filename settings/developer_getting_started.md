# What is Shimmer?
Shimmer is an innovation network where the community tries out new protocol changes before we are deploying them on the more conservative IOTA network. It has its own supply of tokens called $SMR, and is a network with value, NOT a Testnet!

The Shimmer network uses the new IOTA Stardust protocol that upgrades the current IOTA Chrysalis protocol version by introducing computation and utility to the ledger by introducing several new features.

### Shimmer Public Testnet - Environment for Developers
The testnet is the public infrastructure for developers. It runs the beta releases of the IOTA Stardust software and runs a faucet to get tokens for testing easily.

Node API: <https://api.testnet.shimmer.network/>
Example info endpoint: <https://api.testnet.shimmer.network/api/core/v2/info>
Available routes: <https://api.testnet.shimmer.network/api/routes>

# Smart Contracts Development
## The Shimmer EVM Testnet

The easiest way to get started developing on the Shimmer EVM Testnet is to connect to our public node infrastructure through Metamask. 

### Chain details
Network name: ShimmerEVM Testnet
JSON-RPC Endpoint: <https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/>
Websocket JSON-RPC Endpoint: <wss://ws.json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/>
Explorer URL: <https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/>
Chain ID: 1071
Token name: SMR

You can monitor the chain using the block explorer <https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/>

You can use the EVM toolkit <https://evm-toolkit.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/> to add the Testnet to your Metamask settings at the click of a button, request some Testnet SMR through the Faucet <https://evm-toolkit.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/> and start interacting with any deployed dApps â€“ or deploy your own!

We offer a faucet service for several common simulated bridged tokens (fETH, fBTC, fUSDT, etc.) on the Testnet, which enables you to experiment with these assets. We encourage dApps to use these tokens instead of their own simulated bridged tokens, as this will ensure compatibility and interoperability across different applications without requiring a swap. The ERC20 simulated token faucet can be found here <https://evm-faucet.testnet.shimmer.network/>.
