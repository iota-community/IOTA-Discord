Welcome to the official IOTA & Shimmer Discord Server

_Please make sure to read and agree upon these house rules_

This Discord server aims to discuss research, technology, community development, and collaboration with the IOTA Foundation. 

**House Rules**

- Please be respectful to one another, regardless of what is being said. We won't tolerate disrespectful language or inappropriate emoji responses. 
- This server is about technology, not coin prices. But, we are currently allowing speculation again on this server under some strict conditions.
- This server is intended as a family-friendly server where anyone interested in IOTA & Shimmer can contribute, regardless of age. Please refrain from posting material that isn't deemed "family-friendly."
- Advertising on this server is not allowed. But, we allow projects that use the IOTA/Shimmer technology to inform the community of their progress. This is permitted only in the ðŸ¦„ï½œpromote-your-project channel, which was created explicitly for this reason. Please note, none of the projects that post on this server are formally endorsed by the IOTA Foundation. Make sure to do your own research and read the disclaimer in the channel.

Off-topic talk is only allowed in the <#397873500326461448> and the <#738665041217323068> channel as long as it's respectful, family-friendly, and not about religion/politics. Talks about coin prices are limited to the <#738665041217323068> channel. 
- If you need help or technical support, use the dedicated <#398499876935303186> channel.
- Coin shilling is not allowed. Serious discussion about other coins is allowed in <#738665060515315842>.

## Message 3

**Security Considerations**

- The team will never DM you first!
- Do NOT use online recovery phrase/seed generators or any other tools offering such things (e.g., alternative wallets) unless you fully trust the third party offering them; you are giving them access to your funds by doing this. 
- Do not share any information or any social media accounts that might contain personal details. 
- We never ask you to transfer or exchange funds for us, and don't trust any DM you receive with a similar request. Also, the Iota Foundation (or any other "helper") will never ask for your recovery phrase. Please notify the moderators if this happens.
- Please report such behavior to our moderators if you become aware of it.
