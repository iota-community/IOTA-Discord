For the Discord onboarding, 5 channels are needed where `@everyone` can write


The Double Counter gives an `Unverified` role to everyone as soon as they join
The `Unverified` role cannot write in `#general`
Once people are verified, the `Unverified` role is removed, and they can write in the Discord again through the verified `TuringTestPassed` role
