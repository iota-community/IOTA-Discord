### !spec

You can join the {#speculation} channel by going to the {#rank-yourself} channel and typing `!rank speculation`

### !theway

If you've received a transaction with the message "Do you know the way?" or any other message this isn't anything malicious but just regular harmless spam. The Tangle and addresses containing IOTA tokens are publicly available for everyone, anyone willing to spend some resources on sending transactions can do this. Again, this is harmless and you can just ignore it.

### !hornetissue

In order to foster the development of HORNET, it is necessary to collect issues/feature requests in one place: GitHub. If you run into issues or have feature requests, please open an issue on the HORNET GitHub issue page (https://github.com/gohornet/hornet/issues). Reporting crashes or other problems solely on Discord doesn't allow us to prioritize or correctly manage them. When creating an issue on GitHub, please append as much of the log, your particular configuration and other details to the issue, to help us resolving it.

### !houserules

questions related to mana are best asked in the {#tanglemath} channel here in the Discord Server

### !firefly-funds

This can occasionally happen and will be fixed in further releases. To fix it and get direct access to your funds do the following: Make sure that you have a backup of your 24 Seed words and also the stronghold backup file created in the initial profile setup for the migration. If you are sure you have this please uninstall Firefly from your operating System.
Now you need to delete the remaining Firefly folder on your OS located here:
```
Windows: "C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming\Firefly 
Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Firefly 
Linux: ~/.config/Firefly 
```

After you have deleted those folder please install Firefly again from the newest release on the Firefly Website, create a profile and use the “Migrate or restore a wallet” Function.

Now use your Firefly recovery phrase or your File backup (stronghold File)
To restore your Migration profile.
The funds will appear as Balance and you can start using Firefly with your tokens.
